In the context of web development, a proxy is a server or middleware that sits between the frontend and backend servers and forwards requests and responses between them. It's often used to overcome cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) restrictions and to provide additional features like logging, authentication, or caching.

In your case, if you're using a proxy, it's likely configured in your frontend project's setup to redirect certain requests to your backend server. This is common in projects where the frontend and backend are separate entities but need to communicate.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Proxy Configuration (Frontend)**: In your frontend project, you might have a `package.json` file that includes a "proxy" field specifying the address of your backend server. For example:

    ```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
    ```

   This means that any requests from the frontend that aren't handled by the frontend itself will be forwarded to `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **API Requests (Frontend)**: When your frontend makes API requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), it doesn't need to specify the full URL of your backend. Instead, it can use relative URLs, and the proxy will take care of forwarding the requests to the correct backend server.

   For example, if you have a route `/movies` on your backend, your frontend code might make a request like:

    ```javascript
    fetch("/movies")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data))
      .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
    ```

   Thanks to the proxy configuration, this request would be sent to `http://localhost:5000/movies` behind the scenes.

3. **Backend Handling Requests**: On the backend, your server should be configured to handle requests at the specified endpoint (e.g., `/movies`). Your server logic, as you've shown in your previous code snippets, handles these requests and interacts with the database.

In summary, the proxy simplifies the process of making API requests from your frontend by abstracting away the need to specify the full URL of your backend server. It ensures that requests are forwarded to the correct backend endpoint. This is particularly useful during development when your frontend and backend might be running on different ports or domains.
