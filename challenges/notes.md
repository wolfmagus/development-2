1. `if`: This is the start of an "if" statement, which is used to conditionally execute a block of code.

2. `(vowels.includes(word[i].toLowerCase()))`: This is the condition that the "if" statement is checking. Let's break it down further:

   - `vowels`: This is likely an array or a string that contains the characters representing vowels. For example, it could be something like `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']` or a string `"aeiou"`.

   - `.includes(...)`: This is a method used to check if a value is present in an array or a string. It returns `true` if the value is found and `false` otherwise.

   - `word[i]`: This part accesses the character at the `i`-th position of the string `word`. `i` seems to be a variable that represents the current index being checked.

   - `.toLowerCase()`: This method is used to convert the character to lowercase. This is done to make the comparison case-insensitive, so that both uppercase and lowercase vowels are counted.

3. `{ count++; }`: This is the code block that gets executed if the condition in the "if" statement is true. Inside this block, `count` is incremented by 1.

So, in summary, this code snippet checks if the character at the current index `i` in the string `word` is a vowel (case-insensitive) by looking for it in the `vowels` array or string. If it is a vowel, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. This is likely part of a larger program that keeps track of the count of vowels in a word.
